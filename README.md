## Projects
Here are a few projects I'm proud of:
### Game Hub
- [Game Hub](https://symon-game-hub.vercel.app/) - The Mini Game Hub is a showcase project that demonstrates how to utilize the rawg.io API to build a game hub. This project emphasizes fetching data using Axios, handling errors gracefully, and providing a seamless user experience with loading skeletons. Additionally, it leverages Chakra UI for sleek and responsive design, and TypeScript for enhanced code clarity and error checking.
### Memory Card Game
- [Memory Card Game](https://symon-opo-memory-card-project.netlify.app/) - This project aims to create a memory card game where users can test their memory skills by clicking on cards to select them. The game logic is simple yet engaging: clicking on a card increments the score, but clicking on the same card twice in a round resets the score to 0. The game keeps track of the current score and the highest score achieved by the user.
### Battleships Game 
- [Javascript BattleShips game](https://symonogwe.github.io/Battleship-game/) - This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Battleships game, where players strategically place ships on a grid and take turns trying to sink each other's fleet.
Features
- Player vs. Computer: Engage in an exciting one-on-one battle against the computer.
- Ship Placement: Strategically place your ships on the game grid before the battle begins.
- Turn-based Gameplay: Take turns firing shots at your opponent's grid to locate and destroy their ships.
- Win Condition: The first player to destroy all of their opponent's ships wins the game.
### To-Do List
- [To-Do List App](https://symonogwe.github.io/To-Do-List/) - ToDo List App
Welcome to the ToDo List App! This simple yet powerful application helps you stay organized and on top of your tasks. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app utilizes modern web technologies to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.
Features:
- Task Management: Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete effortlessly.
- Local Storage: Your tasks are securely stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
- ES6 Modules: Leveraging the power of ES6 modules, the codebase is modular and maintainable, making it easy to add new features or make updates.
- Webpack Integration: Webpack is used to bundle the JavaScript modules, optimizing performance and improving load times.
- Factory Functions and Constructors/Classes: The app utilizes both factory functions and constructors/classes to efficiently create and manage tasks.
- Use the input field to add new tasks to your list.
- Click on a task to mark it as complete or delete it.
