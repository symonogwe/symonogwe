## Projects
Here are a few projects I'm proud of:
### Mock-Shopping-Cart
- [Mock Shopping Cart](https://mock-shopping-cart.netlify.app/) - This project is a mock e-commerce site built to test understanding of React Router, state management, and testing in React applications. It fetches mock products from fakestoreapi.com and displays them on the store page. Users can view details of each product and add them to their cart. Additionally, they can delete items from the cart. The application's behavior is tested using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure functionality.

Features:
- Fetches mock products from fakestoreapi.com
- Displays products on the store page
- Allows users to view product details and add items to their cart
- Provides functionality to delete items from the cart
- Tested using Jest and React Testing Library
  

### Game Hub
- [Game Hub](https://symon-game-hub.vercel.app/) - The Mini Game Hub is a showcase project that demonstrates how to utilize the rawg.io API to build a game hub. This project emphasizes fetching data using Axios, handling errors gracefully, and providing a seamless user experience with loading skeletons. Additionally, it leverages Chakra UI for sleek and responsive design, and TypeScript for enhanced code clarity and error checking.

Features:
- Fetches mock products from "https://rawg.io/apidocs" API
- Displays the each game genre in the side-bar and the fetched games
- Allows users to search for the games by genres, platform, and relevance
- Provides functionality to also search for a game in the text field and displays loading skeletons while fetching the games

Technologies Used:
- React
- Chakra Ui
- TypeScript
- React-icons
- Axios
  
### Memory Card Game
- [Memory Card Game](https://symon-opo-memory-card-project.netlify.app/) - This project aims to create a memory card game where users can test their memory skills by clicking on cards to select them. The game logic is simple yet engaging: clicking on a card increments the score, but clicking on the same card twice in a round resets the score to 0. The game keeps track of the current score and the highest score achieved by the user. Tested the application using react-testing-library to ensure the game functions as intended. Used Mock Service Worker to mock the fetched response from the "https://rickandmortyapi.com/" API.

Features:

- Memory Game: Click on a unique card to select it.
- Scoring System: Incremental scoring for each unique card clicked.
- Game Over on Duplicate Click: Reset score to 0 if the same card is clicked twice in a round.
- Highest Score Tracking: Keep track of the user's highest achieved score.
- React & Hooks: Utilizes React and hooks like useState and useEffect for state management while fetching data from an external API.

Technologies Used:
- React
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Vitest
- Mock Service Worker
  
### Battleships Game 
- [Javascript BattleShips game](https://symonogwe.github.io/Battleship-game/) - This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Battleships game, where players strategically place ships on a grid and take turns trying to sink each other's fleet.
  
Features:

- Player vs. Computer: Engage in an exciting one-on-one battle against the computer.
- Ship Placement: Strategically place your ships on the game grid before the battle begins.
- Turn-based Gameplay: Take turns firing shots at your opponent's grid to locate and destroy their ships.
- Win Condition: The first player to destroy all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Jest
  
### To-Do List
- [To-Do List App](https://symonogwe.github.io/To-Do-List/) - ToDo List App
Welcome to the ToDo List App! This simple yet powerful application helps you stay organized and on top of your tasks. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app utilizes modern web technologies to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Features:

- Task Management: Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete effortlessly.
- Local Storage: Your tasks are securely stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
- ES6 Modules: Leveraging the power of ES6 modules, the codebase is modular and maintainable, making it easy to add new features or make updates.
- Webpack Integration: Webpack is used to bundle the JavaScript modules, optimizing performance and improving load times.
- Factory Functions and Constructors/Classes: The app utilizes both factory functions and constructors/classes to efficiently create and manage tasks.
- Use the input field to add new tasks to your list.
- Click on a task to mark it as complete or delete it.
  
### Weather App
- [Weather App](https://symonogwe.github.io/Weather-App/) -This weather app harnesses the power of the www.weatherapi.com to provide users with up-to-date weather information for their desired location. Developed with a focus on asynchronous programming in JavaScript, this project demonstrates proficiency in handling asynchronous tasks efficiently. It utilizes promises, async/await syntax and the native fetch API to ensure smooth data retrieval and display.

Features:

- Real-Time Weather Updates: Fetches and displays current weather data for a specified location.
- Location-based Forecast: Provides detailed weather forecasts based on the user's input.
- Responsive Design: Ensures optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- Sleek User Interface: Offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface for ease of use.

Technologies Used:
- JavaScript: Utilized for frontend development and asynchronous programming.
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the user interface.
- WeatherAPI: Integrated to retrieve accurate weather data.
- Promises & Async/Await: Implemented to manage asynchronous operations effectively.
- Fetch API: Employed for making HTTP requests to the weather API.
